Once in a while, I like to take quick stolls. I enjoy walking,
side by side with the streams of water that somehow manage to 
escape the flow of the river that provides for the town of 
Sömerfâgell. It makes me feel connected to nature in a special
way, as if it was nature itself that needed something of me and
not the other way around.

Be it as it is, it's my intention to keep this habit for as long
as my body allows me.

During my walks I contact with my very own self. I listen to the
franctic conversations and dilemmas that hide in the noise of the
city until they no longer have anything to say. Then I start a
conversation with me, with the trees, the leaves, the tricksters
streams of water, the roots. 

This moments are for me.
